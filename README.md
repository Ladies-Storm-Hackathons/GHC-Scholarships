Please note that the companies listed are from corporate sponsors which still
host a certain number of spaces/tickets for students.  As it stands, regular
student sign ups have a waitlist and unless you get off the waitlist,
sponsorships from corporate sponsors are technically the only other way to
guarantee space at GHC 2015.

But keep trying. Don't lose hope. You are awesome.
