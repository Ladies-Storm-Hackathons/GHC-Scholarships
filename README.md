Please note that the companies listed are from corporate sponsors which still host a certain number of spaces/tickets for 
students.  As it stands, regular student sign ups have a waitlist and unless you get off the waitlist, sponsorhips from 
corporate sponsors are technically the only other way to guarantee space at GHC 2015.

But keep trying. Don't lose hope. You are awesome.
